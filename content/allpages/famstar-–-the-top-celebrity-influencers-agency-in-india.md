          Celebrities are macro or mega influencers who have over million
          followers on social media platforms. Because of their high
          follower/subscriber count, they are extremely visible on social media.
          Because they spend a lot of time on their channels with their
          audience, you can expect them to generate a considerable amount of
          engagement.


          If you’re looking for an instant boost for your brand’s image and online status, one of the best ways would be to collaborate with celebrity influencers. They can be pretty expensive, but the exposure their name and channel will offer your brand will make it totally worth it.


          #### By working with celebrities, you’ll get to –


          * Increase your brand awareness

          * Influence buyer decisions

          * Educate your audience

          * Build brand’s credibility and authority
